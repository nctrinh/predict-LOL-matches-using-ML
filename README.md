# üéÆ Predict League of Legends Matches using Machine Learning

This repository provides machine learning models to **predict the outcome of League of Legends (LoL) matches**.  
The project explores different ML approaches such as **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost**, combined with preprocessing and feature engineering to improve accuracy.
